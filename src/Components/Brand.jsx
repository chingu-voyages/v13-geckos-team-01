                    Our website main focus will be nutrition and health. 
                    Our MVP will use an API to get a list of foods and some data 
                    about their nutritional value. There are already some websites 
                    that do this like for example: <a href="https://caloriecontrol.org/healthy-weight-tool-kit/food-calorie-calculator/?" > 
                    here </a>, <a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/healthtool-food-calorie-counter" > here </a> 
                    and <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/calorie-checker/" > here </a>, 
                    but perhaps we could add more information in order to make ourselves 
                    different from ‘competitors’.
                    
                    As mentioned before, the site main focus will be nutrition, therefore 
                    the website will have a theme related to such subject as it will be illustrated 
                    in the following sections.</p>
                    <div className="text-center">
                        <Button size="lg" href="/search">Get Started</Button>
                    </div>
                </Col>
            </Row>
        </Container>
    )
